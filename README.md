# Youth Privacy Protection and Online Gaming (YPPOG)

This research project was initiated during my Master 1 in Data & AI at the [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/masters/mention-informatique/master-year-1-data-and-artificial-intelligence) in collaboration with **Benjamin NGUYEN** and **Nicolas SOULIE** at the [Institut DATAIA](https://www.dataia.eu/index.php/node/950). I am continuing to develop this project during my Master 2 studies and into my PhD.


## Project Overview

The **YPPOG project** explores whether private data (e.g., age, gender, and region of residence) can be inferred from game data, with a primary focus on determining if a player is a minor. This research is critical for enhancing youth privacy protection in online gaming environments.


## Data

### Data Selection

An initial list of multiplayer games was compiled, focusing on those with accessible APIs for data retrieval. After testing multiple APIs, we selected the following:

- **Riot API**: for League of Legends, Legends of Runeterra, and Teamfight Tactics.
- **Steam API**
- **PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds API**

We currently focus on League of Legends due to its global player base, significant popularity, and extensive youth participation.

### Data Collection

To gather data, we collaborated with player privacy protection organizations and university gaming associations. Participants completed a consent form and a survey, allowing us to collect demographic information and game data. Python scripts were developed to facilitate data cleaning and collection, which can be found within each gameâ€™s folder.

The main functions are:

* **cleanTarget(data : pd.DataFrame)** :  Available in *targetCleaner.py*, this function cleans demographic data collected from participants. It takes a pandas DataFrame as input and outputs a cleaned DataFrame with target variables and game identifiers.

* **getData(targets : pd.DataFrame)** : Located in *getDataMultiplePlayers.py*, this function collects and cleans in-game data for each participant. It takes a DataFrame of target data and returns a DataFrame with game feature data.

Example usage of these functions is provided in *getData.ipynb* within each game folder. Currently, we are collecting data from all matches played since 2022.


## Prediction Approaches

Our prediction task is structured around two primary methodologies:

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering the data to identify patterns that may correlate with demographic information without a predefined model.
- **Supervised Learning**: Developing predictive models to infer demographic attributes, ideally with limited data, simulating a privacy attacker scenario.

### Hypotheses for Feature Selection

Some initial hypotheses for identifying minors include:

- **Playing patterns**: Minors may play mostly in the evenings or on weekends.
- **Session length**: Minors may have shorter sessions due to parental controls.

Other demographic characteristics might also be inferred from gaming behavior:

- **Region of residence**: Could potentially be inferred based on regional vacation times.
- **Employment status**: Those unemployed may play more often during daytime hours.

## Preliminary results

While awaiting the collection of project-specific data, I utilized a publicly available dataset [1] to perform initial experiments and test predictive models.

### Dataset Overview

The dataset contains demographic and game-related attributes for each player, including:

- PlayerID: Unique identifier for each player.
- Age: Age of the player.
- Gender: Gender of the player.
- Location: Geographic location of the player.
- GameGenre: Genre of the game the player is engaged in.
- PlayTimeHours: Average hours spent playing per session.
- InGamePurchases: Indicates whether the player makes in-game purchases (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- GameDifficulty: Difficulty level of the game.
- SessionsPerWeek: Number of gaming sessions per week.
- AvgSessionDurationMinutes: Average duration of each gaming session in minutes.
- PlayerLevel: Current level of the player in the game.
- AchievementsUnlocked: Number of achievements unlocked by the player.
- EngagementLevel: Categorized engagement level reflecting player retention ('High', 'Medium', 'Low').

### Approach

Although the dataset was designed to predict player engagement levels using both demographic and game data, I repurposed it to investigate whether demographic attributes (such as age, gender, and location) could be predicted based solely on game-related features.

This approach allowed me to conduct exploratory analysis and test preliminary models to assess the feasibility of demographic inference from gaming behavior.

## Requirements

To utilize the functions in this project, install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: API keys are required for data retrieval from each of the gaming APIs.


## Future work

Several key areas remain for further development:

- Updating the target cleaner function to align with the finalized online consent form.
- Conducting in-depth analysis to examine correlations between game data and demographic attributes.
- Collaborating with experts in each game to identify relevant in-game data that could contribute to privacy-related predictions.
- Collect data.
- Extending data collection functions to games beyond League of Legends.
